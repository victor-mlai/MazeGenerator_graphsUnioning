Maze Generator by unionning graphs
Warning! stroboscopic Output! delete the system("cls"); from the loops to see the final result.

Considering this "maze under construction" where every " - " is a graph that contains exactly 1 node.

We choose randomly 2 adiacent nodes from 2 different graphs and unite them.

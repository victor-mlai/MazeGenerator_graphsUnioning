Maze Generator by unionning graphs

I used the OneLoneCoder's header to create a new console in which to draw the maze.
I created 2 threads: one that draws the maze and one that creates it and then solves it.


Algorithm for Generating the maze:
Considering this "maze under construction" where each square is a graph that contains exactly 1 node.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ..    13
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 1
| - | - | - | - | - | - | 2
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 3 
| - | - | - | - | - | - | 4
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 5
| - | - | - | - | - | - | 6
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 7
| - | - | - | - | - | - | .
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ .
| - | - | - | - | - | - | .
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ .
| - | - | - | - | - | - | .
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 13

We choose randomly 2 adiacent nodes from 2 different graphs and unite them.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ..    13
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 1
| - | - | - | - | - | - | 2
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 3 
| - | - | - | - | - | - | 4
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 5
| - | - |       | - | - | 6
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 7
| - | - | - | - | - | - | .
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ .
| - | - | - | - | - | - | .
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ .
| - | - | - | - | - | - | .
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 13

And repeat until there is only one graph

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ..    13	   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ..    13	
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 1	   +---+---+---+---+---+---+ 1	
| - | - | - | - | - | - | 2	   | - | - | - | - | - | - | 2

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ..    13
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 1
|   |       |           | 2

+   +---+   +---+   +---+ 11
|       |               | 12
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 13

And then solve it using bfs with prioritised direction

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ..    13
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 1
|   |       |     >   >   2
+   +---+   +   +   +---+ 3
|           |   | ^   < | 4
+---+---+   +---+---+   + 5
|       | >   v     | ^ | 6
+   +---+   +   +---+   + 7
| >   >   ^ | >   >   ^ | 8
+   +---+---+---+   +---+ 9
| ^     |       |       | 10
+   +---+   +---+   +---+ 11
  ^     |               | 12
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 13

E.g.: if the exit is Top Right corner and it has to choose between going Left or Right,
		it will choose going Right because it's closer to the exit.
